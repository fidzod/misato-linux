Misato Linux is a minimal and opinionated rice for void linux which features an aesthetic hyprland configuration and custom quickshell components. Featuring a smooth and easy-to-use installer, tutorial, and other features which bridge the gap between DEs and WMs.

To be clear, Misato Linux isn't a distro, it is a void rice with a custom iso and installer. Though it is recommended you install Misato Linux from the ISO, you can also install Void Linux yourself and run the post-installation script:

```bash
curl https://get.misatolinux.org/post-install.sh | sh -
```
