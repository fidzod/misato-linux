<img src="banner.png" width="622px" alt="Banner">

Misato Linux is a minimal and opinionated rice for void linux. Featuring a smooth and easy-to-use installer, tutorial, and other features which bridge the gap between DEs and WMs. Featuring an aesthetic hyprland configuration with custom quickshell components.

Misato Linux isn't a distro, it is a void rice with a custom iso and installer, however if Omarchy can call itself a distro...

You can install Misato Linux using the ISO, or you can install Void Linux yourself and run the post-installation script.
